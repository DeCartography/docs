DeCartography is Relation Computational Oracle. whihch provides Credible Neutrality Social Graph powered by Web3 crowdsourcing. 

Some other existing social graph provider "analyze data, create a social graph, and provide results to other apps", but DeCartography stands out by employing a complex system for analysis instead of a pure mathematical approach. 

Traditional Relational Oracles require predefined metrics for their mathematical methods. In contrast, our use of crowdsourcing and the peer prediction method allows data generation based on Schelling Points, bypassing the need for specific metrics.

Here's how you use it as a computation oracle: If there's data you need to analyze, you simply send the data along with the service fee to the DeCartography platform. After a specified period, the analyzed data is returned to you. At the moment, we're in beta, focusing the data from projects that have reached out to us.

As a crowd-worker, you can earn cryptocurrency with no need for KYC. You start by connecting your wallet to the DeCartography platform, and after completing a task and waiting a specified period, your reward is automatically transferred. Future plans include a feature to increase earnings by staking before task commencement.

## Some key features

- Consensus mechanism as a computational oracle: In the absence of a Grand truth, we solve the problem of determining validator compensation in a distributed oracle using Schelling Point mechanism. This concept revolves around "multiple entities defaulting to a common solution to a problem in the absence of communication".

- Task Creation and Assignment: Tasks are created and assigned mathematically.

- Sybil Attack Prevention: We use Gitcoin Passport and Staking to prevent Sybil attacks.

- Quantifying each agent's work (Reward Calculation): Each agent's reward calculation uses the Peer Prediction Method to determine rewards based on the correlation of each agent's answers.

- Reward Distribution: Rewards are distributed at regular intervals via the Instant Distribution Agreement (IDA) by Superfulid
