This section is based on the Round1 experiment involving 17,023 participants from the Gitcoin Citizens Round #1, jointly conducted by DeCartography and Gitcoin. These figures are subject to updates in the future.

1. DeCartography generates tasks for crowd-workers from a list of addresses included in the dataset to be analyzed.
2. For the crowd-workers, 9 addresses along with the NFTs each address owns are displayed.
3. From the displayed group of addresses, crowd-workers select three addresses they intuitively feel are similar, and then submit them. This is defined as a single task.
4. In one session, 10 tasks are given.
5. Crowd-workers solve these tasks, and the responses are stored in DeCartography's database, serving as metrics for generating the next tasks.
