Due to its experimental nature, DeCartography verifies its hypotheses by cycling through experimental rounds. We plan to gradually increase the scale at regular intervals, similar to Gitcoin and Optimism's RetroPGF.

## Round1

The first round of DeCartography is scheduled to take place in the fall of 2023.
In the first round, a total reward of $3,000 (ETH) will be distributed to the contributors who contributed as crowd-workers in the joint demonstration experiment by DeCartography and Gitcoin.
