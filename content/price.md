Once a cluster is found in the Golden Standard section, it can be used to assign clusters for new wallets. If you have already found seven or eight clusters that most wallets seem to follow, you can start by analyzing the new wallets (say 30,000 or 40,000) against the existing clusters.
Furthermore, if a wallet has been tested against two or three clusters, it can be placed somewhere in between them. This is accomplished by creating a notion of distance between wallets.

The amount of data and the price will depend on how much data is to be analyzed, and the number of tasks required will depend on the speed at which clusters are found and the consensus among the users.

The minimum number of tasks after finding enough clusters is (number of clusters)*(number of wallets).
