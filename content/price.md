# algorithm
After the clusters are found in the Golden standard part of the website, they can subsequently be used for assigning the cluster for new wallets. So if we already have found 7 or 8 clusters that most wallets seem to follow, then we can start by analyzing the new wallets (say 30,000 or 40,000) against the existing clusters, that way we can get data that connects old and new wallets furthermore, if a wallet tests against two or three clusters, we can put it somewhere in between them to create the notion of distance between wallets

the amount of data depends on which gitcoin round we analyze, the required number of tasks depend on how fast clusters can be found and how much concensus there is between users, the minimum number of tasks after we find enough clusters is the (number of clusters) * (the number of wallets)
