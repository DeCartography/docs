Under implementation, feature release date to be determined.

Crowd workers can voluntarily staking before starting to solve a task. The Voting Weight will increase according to that amount. In other words, if they solve the same task and send the same response, a crowdworker who staked will receive more money as a reward than a crowdworker who did not staking.

However, if the crowd worker is lazy (low Average Match Count of the answers sent), the staked amount may be slashed. This serves as a sybil measure and a decentralized oracle manipulation measure.
