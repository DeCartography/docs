Since we use the peer prediction method to evaluate crowdworker responses, once all responses are collected, we need to calculate the correlation and the percentage to distribute the reward. Therefore, the current system does not allow for remittance of rewards at the moment the **work is completed. **

Currently, we calculate the correlation after the Round is completed, and remit the reward after that. When the work is finished, you will be able to register your e-mail address. Once registered, you will receive a notification when you are ready to remit. With batch operation remittance, rewards are distributed after a certain period of time that you have worked on the task.
